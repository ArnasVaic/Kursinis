## Most important things

Have a clear definition of done.

Very old sources are suspicious, if any are used have a good enough reason, because the paper has to be novel and somewhat relevant.

Results(rezultas) vs conclusion (i≈°vada)

Result - factual result what was found/observed.
Conclusion - interpretation of the results.

Don't make conclusion about yourself (I learned ...).

# Problem 1 notes

This page contains the theory needed to arrive to a solution for problem 1.

## Linear operator

Paul's book, page 551

An operator $L$ is linear iff it satisfies the given

$$ L(c_1u_1+c_2u_2) = c_1L(u_1)+c_2L(u_2) $$

### Useful facts
- Separation of variables only works if the PDE is linear and boundary conditions are homogenous.

  abstract = {Mathematical and numerical models of the yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) synthesis are presented in the article. The models allow the effective computer simulation of the YAG synthesis. The synthesis by sol–gel and solid-state reaction methods is considered in the article. The question concerning the reasons for the observed changes in the preparation temperature by changing synthesis method is answered. The inverse modelling problem is solved: using known experimental data (synthesis time, dimensions of reactants) the unknown input parameters of the model (diffusion and reaction rate coefficients) are calculated.},

  abstract = {There is a model of yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) synthesis presented in this article. The developed model is based on nonlinear reaction–diffusion partial differential equations. The solution was carried out numerically using finite difference techniques. We got dependability curves for diffusion and reaction rates and offered possible method to localize values of diffusion and reaction rate constants precisely enough.},

  abstract = {Yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) powder was synthesized by a mixed solvothermal method under moderate conditions (260--290{$\circ$}C, 2--4h) with inexpensive aluminum and yttrium hydroxides as the precursors, and a low-cost ethanol--water solution (the volume ratio of ethanol to water ⩾2:1) as the solvent. The presence of ethanol in mixed solvent is beneficial to the formation of YAG. The synthesized powder consists of well-dispersed and nearly spherical fine grains (80nm on average) with a relatively narrow grain size distribution. The powder form is the most desirable for the compacting and sintering of YAG ceramics.},

  abstract = {Recently, we presented a method for estimation of the diffusion and reaction rates of synthesis at high temperatures using limited information, such as synthesis time and dimensions of reactants, from real laboratory experiments (Mackevičius et~al. in Central Eur J Chem 10(2):380–385, 2012). There, we restricted ourselves to the one- and two-dimensional models. Having both adapted our computing program to the three-dimensional case and significantly speeded it up, now we are able present the results in the three-dimensional model. Solving an inverse modeling problem, we obtain explicit formulas for the diffusion coefficient and reaction rate as functions of temperature. We calculate the activation energies and other parameters, thus obtaining conditions for occurrence of synthesis. In addition, using the results of the three-dimensional model, we find the optimal temperature for energy consumption in the YAG synthesis.},

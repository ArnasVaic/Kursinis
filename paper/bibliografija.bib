In recent years the researchers have explored the number of ways to improve the quality of cutting, drilling and micromachining of different materials (metals, alloys, ceramics and composites) using Nd:YAG lasers. This paper reviews the experimental investigations carried out to study the effect of various factors/process parameters on the performance of Nd:YAG laser beam machining. The importance of different design of experiments (DOE) methodologies used by various investigators for achieving the optimum value of different quality characteristics has also been discussed in paper.},

There, we restricted ourselves to the one- and two-dimensional models. Having both adapted our computing program to the three-dimensional case and significantly speeded it up, now we are able present the results in the three-dimensional model. Solving an inverse modeling problem, we obtain explicit formulas for the diffusion coefficient and reaction rate as functions of temperature. We calculate the activation energies and other parameters, thus obtaining conditions for occurrence of synthesis. In addition, using the results of the three-dimensional model, we find the optimal temperature for energy consumption in the YAG synthesis.},

  abstract = {Gels of yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) with the stoichiometric composition 3Y2O3{$\cdot$}5AI2O3, were prepared by a sol-gel technique and dried by supercritical extraction with CO2. Powders were produced by lightly grinding the dried gels. Crystallization of the powder occurred at {$\approx$}900{$^\circ$}C and within the limits of detection, the X-ray diffraction pattern of the crystallized material was identical to that of the stoichiometric composition. Powder compacts with a green density of {$\approx$}0.50 of the theoretical were sintered to nearly full density in O2 during constant heating rate sintering at 5 {$^\circ$}C min-1 to 1600 {$^\circ$}C. This is better than the density obtained with powders from a similar gel dried conventionally (by evaporation of the liquid) and considerably better than that obtained with powders prepared by solid state reaction. The room temperature flexural strength and fracture toughness of the material fabricated from the supercritically dried gels were 190 MPa and 2.2 MPa.m1/2, respectively. These strength and fracture toughness values are higher than those reported in other studies for YAG produced by the sintering route.},

However, YAG powders synthesized by several methods do not satisfy commercial requirements in mobility, size distribution, luminescent intensity, etc. With flux added in the synthesis, well-shaped crystallites can nucleate and grow in the wetted micro domains. High temperature compensates the adverse effect of intermediate product on particle size. The final products are phosphor powders composed of uniformly distributed large particles. Preferred orientation in the XRD patterns confirms that the isolated particles are single crystals other than agglomeration of fine grains. This kind of phosphors has a better performance in WLED devices. This work will improve the commercial production of WLED phosphors.},

A clinical trial was designed, including adults with active deep carious lesions on permanent teeth who were divided into two groups, i.e., control group and intervention group treated with CT and Er:YAG therapy, respectively. Before and after any conservative treatment, two oral samples were collected using a small sterile microbrush scrubbed within the base of the dentinal cavity tissue. The percentage of reduction and the colony-forming units (CFUs) count after Er:YAG and conventional treatments were compared for total microorganisms, including Candida spp., Streptococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. The microbial reduction varied from 90.2\% to 100\% and was significantly observed for total microorganisms and Streptococcus spp. (p {$<$} 0.05). The Er:YAG laser shows the potential for clinical applications, especially with paediatric and complicated patients, thanks to its minimally invasive properties and its effect on the reduction of microbial load.},
